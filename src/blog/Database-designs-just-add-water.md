  Great artists steal

Barry Williams runs a cool website called [Database Answers](http://www.databaseanswers.org/). I'm not really up on the whole 'database as art' thing, although I am married to a DBA so I probably should get a better understanding of things... right now, they're just a data store to me.

Anyway, one of the cool things Barry offers is a bunch (I may even say plethora) of [free data models](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/). Now, mind you, these aren't supposed to offer someone a perfect solution, or even a complete solution, but they are awesome building blocks. Or, if you're in a jam, they're also valuable ways to look for alternative modelling solutions.
