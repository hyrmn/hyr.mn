My wife and I both work remote. I mean, lots of developers do right now in the time of COVID, but we've been doing it for a while.

I bought a new computer in February 2019. My goal at the time was something portable with decent battery life. We spent about half of 2019 on the road.  I haven't been ready to fully embrace that desktop life, but I did make some purchases in December. (and my wife bought me the poster)

**Chair**: Herman Miller Celle. I found it to be more comfortable than the Aeron and significantly cheaper. I like a metal folding chair, though, so take it with a grain of salt.

**Desk**: Ikea something or other. It's their manual crank adjustable desk. (I distrust technology). Even if you don't stand during the day, it's nice to be able to adjust throughout the day. I've owned and really like a Multitable in the past but this was a cheaper option.

**Computer**: Lenovo Thinkpad T-480s. If I were doing it over, I'd get the full T-480 with 32GB of RAM (mine has 24) and a large battery.

**Monitor**: LG 34" ultrawide with USB-C. The single-cable connection to the laptop is very nice. I love how it cleans the desk up. I plug my keyboard and mouse into the laptop too (and it has enough juice to power their lights).

**Keyboard**: [Drop CTRL](https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard) with Halo Clears. It's a joy to type on and the build quality is amazing. I also own a WASD Keyboard tenkeyless that I enjoy and a [Keyboardio Model 01](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-01-keyboard) that I keep meaning to use more and keep not using more.

**Mouse**: Roccat Kone XTD. It's got adjustable weighting and an optical sensor. This model is quite old and it's held up well with some tarnishing. 

**Headset**: Some cheap-ish HyperX. They're _ok_ but not _great_. I've had some AKG K240 MK II headphones in the past that I loved.

**Sundry**: [Fuck It Ship It poster](https://www.startupvitamins.com/products/startup-poster-fuck-it-ship-it). [Glorious PC Gaming Race desk pad](https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-xxl-gaming-mouse-pad).
