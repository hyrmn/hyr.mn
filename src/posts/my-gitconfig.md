  Tips, tricks, and stupid things you can do with Git

I program on Windows. I use PowerShell and the most excellent [Posh-Git](http://dahlbyk.github.io/posh-git/) for most of my interactions with git. Below is my .gitconfig with some aliases that I use (or don't, but found funny to figure out and include... we all spend our Friday nights in our own way).

I keep a current copy of [my .gitconfig on github](https://github.com/hyrmn/dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig). So star it there if you want to track updates.
